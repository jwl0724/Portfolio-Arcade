# Jonathan's Project Arcade (Portfolio Website)

Welcome to my project portfolio website disguised as an arcade built using [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/). This site showcases some of the past projects I have worked on, as well as information about me.

Move in front of the arcade machines and press E (or tap it on mobile) to see my past projects. If you want to learn more about me, go up to the clerk and press E (or again tap) next to the clerk to read about me!

[Click here](https://portfolio-arcade-flame.vercel.app/) to enter the arcade now!
